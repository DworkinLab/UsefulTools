# Image Processing stuff

Just a place to put links to tutorials, software (that may be useful) etc..
This is seperate from anything to do with morphmetrics specifically (but there may be some overlap with automated landmarking)


## Tools

### Image processing in R
[Related CRAN task views, medical imaging](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MedicalImaging.html), has a section on general image processing
[SimpleITK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6168008/)
[EMImage](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html)
[magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) - interface to imageMagick for image processing
[imageR](https://dahtah.github.io/imager/imager.html) - image Processing

### Image processing in python
openCV (CV2)
scikit-image
[ClearMap](https://github.com/ChristophKirst/ClearMap) - ClearMap is a python toolbox for the analysis and registration of volumetric data from cleared tissues.

### Links to stand alone tools
[OMERO, Open Microscope Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/) - OMERO is client-server software for managing, visualizing and analyzing microscopy images and associated metadata.
ImageJ - (java)
Fiji. (fully loaded ImageJ, java) - includes tools like TrackMate
FijiWings

[CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/)  "image processing designed for biologists"
[Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/) - Interactive learning and Image Segmentation
[ImageMagick](imagemagick) - edit, convert images (resize, etc).
 
## Learning to do imageProcessing
[A computational image analysis glossary for biologists](https://dev.biologists.org/content/139/17/3071)
[A tutorial for image processing in R](https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2015/BioC2015/BioC2015Oles.html#1), mostly using EMImage, including some image segmentation
